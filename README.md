# Hepsiburada Android Bootcamp Week 4

Creating 2 UI screens and adding an example activity with using livedata. 

## UI Screens

From the given Figma designs, HomeScreen2 and SignUpScreen2 were used.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>HomeScreen2</td>
     <td>SignUpScreen2</td>    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="https://github.com/Hepsiburada-Mobil-Android-Bootcamp/edakuntalp-odev1/blob/master/Home%20Screen2.jpg" width="400" height="790"></td>
    <td> <img src="https://github.com/Hepsiburada-Mobil-Android-Bootcamp/edakuntalp-odev1/blob/master/SignScreen2.png" width="400" height="790"></td>

## LiveData Example

Creating a simple counting activity using livedata


## Possible Defects 

For the reviewers, I would like to warn them about the possible defects that they will be encoutering. For the Movie UI screen, 2 horizontal scroll views were used. As you know, one must use LinearLayout with those views, therefore, a nested layout -which is stated to be undesirable- has been used. Cardviews also added manually on the xml file, not dynamically on the activity. So the layout files could be seen a little bit messy.
